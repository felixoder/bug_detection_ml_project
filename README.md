A powerful NLP based fine tune Machine learning model that is trained with a huge no of dataset, can detect any python based code as "buggy" or "bug-free" and also it can fix the bug"
and I also have a nice vs code extension [felix-detect-fix] for that

## Features ✨

- 🚀 **Detect Bugs**: Classifies code as "buggy" or "bug-free."
- 🔧 **Fix Bugs**: Automatically suggests fixes for detected issues.

- VIEW **https://github.com/felixoder/felix-detect-fix** to see my extension or you can use it on

## Usage 🚀

- Use google colab if you dont have a local setup. and run the .ipynb files to see / inspect the model generation
- The github_scraped_half.csv is a csv file that consists the scraped data
- The Data_Scraper_github.ipynb scrapes the data from gh [give your ACCESS_TOKEN there]
- The bug_detection.ipynb detects the bugs
- bug_Fixing.ipynb fixes the bugs
- Bug_Detection_Documentation.pdf Theoritical Docs

```
